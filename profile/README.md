# static

Built on GitHub Pages, static enables the creation of basic microsites, targeting a variety of use cases.

## How it Works

Using a `static.json` file, our GitHub Action automatically deploys a static, single-page application based on the `type`.

Under the hood, we translate your `static.json` to a fully functional microsite built on Next.js.

Start with our minimum required configuration, then rely on the automatic deployments based on changes to your `static.json` file to enhance functionality.

## Get Started

1. Create a new repository from one of our templates.
   - [from-static/example-resume](https://github.com/from-static/example-resume)
2. Enable GitHub Actions as your GitHub Pages Source in your new repository.
3. Edit the `static.json`
4. Wait for the GitHub Action to run...
5. View your generated microsite at your repository's GitHub Pages URL.

That's it! Any changes you make to `static.json` will automatically redeploy your site.
